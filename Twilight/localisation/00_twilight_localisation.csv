decision_twilight_abdicate_desc;I grow tired more easily these days. The crown weighs heavy on my poor old head. Perhaps it is time to retire and let [This.Heir.GetBestName] rule in my stead?;x

decision_twilight_abdicate_tt;Summon [This.Heir.GetBestName] at once! We need to talk...;x

EVENTTITLEtwilight.0001;The crown is heavy and I am weary...;x

EVENTDESCtwilight.0001;[Root.Heir.GetFirstName] stands before me, with a somewhat puzzled look on [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] face. This is a great burden I would to ask [Root.Heir.GetHerHim] to bear.
"You wished to see me, [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFOA]?", [Root.Heir.GetSheHe] finally asks.

EVTOPTtwilight.0002.5;I'll be in my library...;x
