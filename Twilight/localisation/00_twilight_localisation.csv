decision_twilight_abdicate_desc;I grow tired more easily these days. The crown weighs heavy on my poor old head. Perhaps it is time to retire and let [This.Heir.GetBestName] rule in my stead?;x
decision_twilight_abdicate_desc_extra;Summon my council!;x
decision_twilight_abdicate_tt;Summon [This.Heir.GetBestName] at once! We need to talk...;x

EVENTTITLEtwilight.0001;The crown is heavy and I am weary...;x

EVENTDESCtwilight.0001;[Root.Heir.GetFirstName] stands before me, with a somewhat puzzled look on [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] face. This is a great burden I would to ask [Root.Heir.GetHerHim] to bear.
"You wished to see me, [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFOA]?", [Root.Heir.GetSheHe] finally asks.

I nod and smile. Is [Root.Heir.GetSubjectPronoun] ready for this? Am I?

I take a deep breath.;x

EVTOPTtwilight.0001.1;I am old and tired, [GetFromRelation]. It is time for you to take the crown.;x
EVTOPTtwilight.0001.2;I... seem to have forgotten why I summoned you. I must be getting old...;x

EVENTTITLEtwilight.0002;It is done, I can rest;x
EVENTDESCtwilight.0002;There is a long, somber moment of silence between us. As the meaning of my words sinks in my [GetFromRelation] nods very slowly.
'But what of you? Where will you go?';x

EVTOPTtwilight.0002.1;Do not worry. I will still be here to give you counsel.;x
EVTOPTtwilight.0002.2;I shall become a monk.;x
EVTOPTtwilight.0002.3;Oh, don't worry about me. I will do just fine...;x
EVTOPTtwilight.0002.4;I just want to die in peace, [GetFromRelation].;x
EVTOPTtwilight.0002.5;I'll be in my library...;x

EVENTTITLEtwilight.0010;How the mighty have fallen...;x
EVENTDESCtwilight.0010;The old monarch barges into your council meeting, disheveled and staggering.
The odour of wine and sweat fills the room, as the whispers start.
Grinning and red-faced [twilight_retired_monarch.GetSheHe] roars out a laugh, approaching slowly.

'You lot talk too much! Especially you, [Root.job_chancellor.GetFirstName]!' [twilight_retired_monarch.GetSheHe] bellows, slapping the chancellor on the back.

'I sh-shall... save you some talking! I say we go to war! Now!' [twilight_retired_monarch.GetSheHe] shouts with a raised fist. 'I-I order you to... to...';x

EVTOPTtwilight.0010.1;Enough! Get out, you old fool!;x
EVTOPTtwilight.0010.2;Let me help you...;x
EVTOPTtwilight.0010.3;Guards, take him to his chambers. Now.;x
